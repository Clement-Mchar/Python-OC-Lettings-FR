Database
========

As mentionned earlier, we used SQLite for this project

Interpretation by Django
------------------------
Django Framework, based on python is Class oriented language. This mean that tables are created from *Models*. Models are stored in different *models.py* files.

Each one of them are stored in *application*

Examples here
    * lettings/models
    * profiles/models

In application lettings you will find Address and Letting models

In profiles application you will find Profile model, with a ForeignKey on Django User Base Model

Here is the Profile Model

Django Admin
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django come with an admin section that can be found here::

    http://localhost:8000/admin

This is basically a direct reading of Database
